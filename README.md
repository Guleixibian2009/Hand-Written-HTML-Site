# ðŸ‘‹Hi there~

Welcome to [@Guleixibian2009](https://github.com/guleixibian2009/)'s **Hand-Written-HTML-Site**!

The `Hand-Written-HTML-Site` project is my small experiment to study `HTML` , `CSS` and `JavaScript`. ðŸ˜€

So why wait? **Let's Start!**

This site finally meets its **1.0.0 Version!** Congratulations!

Any great ideas or suggestions? [Contact Us Now!](mailto:guleixibian2009@outlook.com)or [Open an Issue!](https://github.com/Guleixibian2009/Hand-Written-HTML-Site/issues)

## About this project ---- `Hand-Written-HTML-Site`

### 0. Introduction

I started the `Hand-Written-HTML-Site` project on 2022.2.5. I do have a website (actually two), but they are all generated, [one by `Jekyll`](https://guleixibian.github.io/) and [one by `Hexo`](https://guleixibian2009.github.io/) .

When I run generated sites, I can only change some settings and I can't change the source code.

So after I have those two sites, I wonder ðŸ¤¨ whether I can build websites from pure `HTML`.

I have tried several times before, but the effect wasn't exactly what I wanted. ðŸ˜‘ But recently I visited [W3School](https://www.w3school.com.cn/) , I found something new. And then the usage of them makes my `Hand-Written-HTML-Site` becomes more and more elegant.

* * *

### 1. The Main Core --- HTML

Well, this site is completely Hand-Written. I don't use any generators, yes, no `Jekyll`, no `Hexo`, and no `BootStrap`. I wrote it by hand. I used `HTML5` so I can use the `<audio>` tag. See that `<!DOCTYPE html>` ?

* * *

### 2. UI --- CSS and more

#### 2.1 About the appearence and animations

If a website is a person, then `CSS` is his skin. I used `CSS3` to create fantastic appearence for this site. All the background, heading, everything on the page are beautified by `CSS`.

Try hover on my photo on the left. It will spin when your mouse is over it. And try those links too! There will be a Tooltip. Some of the animations are created by `CSS`. Now let me give you an example:

```css
.Sidebar .Author div.Author_Photo img#Author{ 
    transform: rotateZ(0deg);
    transition: transform 2s ease-in-out; 
} 
.Sidebar .Author div.Author_Photo:hover img#Author{ 
    transform: rotateZ(360deg); 
}
```

This makes my photo able to spin. I also used a third-party package for the icons...

* * *

#### 2.2 Font Awesome Icons

Wanna know where are the icons from? They are `Font Awesome` icons. Try them out now:

```html
<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub 
<i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download 
<i class="fa fa-icons"></i> Icons 
<i class="fa fa-palette"></i> Palette
```

That equals to: Amazing, right? ðŸ˜Ž

I used a online kit for those icons(but sadly I only have a free kit). The package I mentioned is call `l-lin/font-awesome-animation`. It allows me to create more kinds of font awesome animations. See `faa-tada` ! I used it because the original animation doesn't work for me. Visit their [website](https://github.com/l-lin/font-awesome-animation/) to see more demo!

#### 2.3 shields.io --- badges

The badges (like![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Guleixibian2009/Hand-Written-HTML-Site?color=lightgreen&label=Article-License&logo=GitHub&style=flat-square)) are generated by `shields.io`. It is a professional badge generator, you can create badges however you like and it's completely free!ðŸ¤‘ Also it can get information from your social accouts,such as `GitHub`, `BiliBili` and so on. You can also create badges manually:

```
https://img.shields.io/badge/<LABEL>-<MESSAGE>-<COLOR>/
```

It's just like filling in the blanks! Go to [shields.io and try it yourself](https://shields.io/)!

* * *

#### 2.4 The fonts I used

Do you like those fonts I used? I'll give you a list of it:

1. Fira Code (that's `Fira Code`)
2. Bigmouth Regular (that's `Bigmouth Regular`)
3. Fabfelt Script (that's `Fabfelt Script`)
4. Gagalin Regular (that's `Gagalin Regular`)
5. Wander Brave (that's `Wander Brave`)

Go to [my repo](https://github.com/guleixibian2009/hand-written-html-site/) and download if you need them!

* * *

### 3. All the functions --- JavaScript

the use of `JavaScript` (actually `jQuery`) allows me to create beautiful animation and function. The `Utility Buttons` the `Survey Banner` are built with `jQuery`. You can Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I to view the source code!

* * *

#### 3.1 JavaScript I wrote

Well actually I didn't want to learn `JavaScript` when I started this project... But once I decided to add a `Survey Banner`, I realized that I need to hide it after several seconds. Then I started to write `JavaScript`.

For example:

```JS
"use strict"; 
$(document).ready(function(){ 
    const banner = $(".Survey_Banner"); 
    function BannerDisappear(){ 
        $(banner).hide(500); 
    } 
    window.setTimeout(BannerDisappear, 10000); 
});
```

If you have learned `JavaScript` for a bit, you will know that `$` stands for `jQuery`.

* * *

#### 3.2 Third-party packages

I'm not a professional programmer, so I used some `npm` packages. They are:

* clipboardJS@2
* jquery.scrollTo@2
* jquery-mousewheel@3
* highlightJS@11

`ClipboardJS` is for the `Copy Button`. Try them now then paste in your editor. `jQuery.scrollTo` is for creating a linear animation when `Back To Top` is on. `jquery-mousewheel` is for listening `mousewheel` events because `jQuery` cannot listen to `mousewheel` events!

The package I like most is `highlightJS`. It's a package to "highlight" your code on a website. It supports more than 180 languages, and it provides many themes. I used the `Atom One Light Theme`. The basics are like this:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@11.4.0/build/styles/atom-one-light.min.css"> 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@11.4.0/build/highlight.min.js"></script> 
<script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>
```

Go to [their website](https://highlightjs.org/) and learn more!

#### 3.3 JSdelivr --- CDNs

So in order to make my website faster, I decided to use some CDNs. For `JavaScript`, I used `JSdelivr`. It may not be very fast in China, but it's better than hosting myself. For images, I used `imgtu.com` to upload. Welcome to visit [my album](https://imgtu.com/album/gIFx0)! For your background music, I used `BitBucket`. It's quite like `GitHub`, but it's much faster.

* * *

So that's all! Thank you for reading~
